# About me

I conduct research on predator ecology, invasive animal management and native mammal conservation. To do so, I use quantitative methods which incorporate uncertainty and socio-economic constraints to improve management and decision-making. In particular, my strengths lie in statistical models which estimate animal density, occupancy, spatio-temporal interactions and the integration of different data sources. I'm also passionate about collaborative, open science that incorporates the knowledge and needs of First Nations people. I am currently finishing up my PhD with the [QAECO](https://qaeco.com) lab on the impact of fox control in south-west Victoria, while tackling the occasional, related contracting job.
