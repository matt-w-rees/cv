# Profile
I use quantitative methods to improve the monitoring and management of threatened and invasive species. My expertise lies in predator ecology, as well as modelling population dynamics and animal interactions using hierarchical models (namely spatial capture-recapture, occupancy-detection and generalised additive models). I apply advanced statistical models to real-world datasets, at spatial scales relevant to managers. Extensive fieldwork experience, particularly with camera-traps, motivates me to properly account for landscape context, feasibility and socio-economic constraints into each of my projects. Currently, I am nearing completion of a PhD with the [*Quantitative and Applied Ecology group*](https://qaeco.com){target="_blank"}.
