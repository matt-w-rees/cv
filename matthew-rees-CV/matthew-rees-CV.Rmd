# Profile
I am a conservation biologist using quantitative methods to tackle real-world management problems. I specialise in modelling population dynamics and species interactions, primarily through the lens of predator ecology and invasive species management. More broadly, I'm interested in transparent science which considers the needs & knowledge of Indigenous people, incorporates uncertainty, multiple data sources and socio-economic constraints to improve decision-making. You can usually find me either in the field or building spatial capture-recapture, occupancy and generalised additive models in R. I am currently finishing up my PhD with the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology group](https://qaeco.com) while tackling the occasional, related contracting job.
